Ruby on Rails developers command some of the highest salaries in the world and here’s a little secret, you don't need any experience to get started. The first thing you'll do is master the basics of the Ruby language, building fun mini-projects along the way and then move on to Rails, starting with the basics, learning everything that goes on under the hood of a Rails application, and through building 4 feature rich web apps you’ll end up with the project management app which is a software as a service app that you can customize and use to launch your own business if you choose! The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course will teach you everything you need to know to design, build and launch your own web applications!
